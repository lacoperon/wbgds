Willeford shot the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, and Langendorff drove the truck while chasing Kelley. (AP) A good guy with a gun, along with his National Rifle Association training, stopped a bad guy with a gun, according to the NRA. On his show this week, Grant Stinchfield, a conservative talk show host on the NRA’s online television network, commended longtime NRA member Stephen Willeford for using his NRA training to conceal himself and find a flat platform to fire off shots at Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed dozens inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex. “The tiny town of Sutherland Springs needed a brave, calm-headed gun owner, an NRA instructor to stop the rampage of a deranged monster,” Stinchfield said, referring to Willeford. The massacre in Texas has ignited both sides of the gun debate, with gun-rights supporters trumpeting Willeford as an example of the need for access to firearms and gun-control advocates saying the tragedy proves again it is too easy for people to get a gun. [ The lives lost in Sutherland Springs, Tex. ] The NRA typically goes silent after a mass shooting, waiting for the shock and anger to recede, The Post’s Michael S. Rosenwald reported. But in Willeford, the NRA has found a man who represents the value of firearm training. Willeford said in the interview with the NRA that he used to shoot at a local, weekly league and the group became NRA instructors. Then they started teaching their kids how to shoot. His three kids became NRA distinguished experts with a pistol, through the organization’s plan, by the time they were 8 years old, he said. “The kids enjoyed it. It was the whole family,” he said. “The range started sending people we didn’t know, said ‘Take your kids down there and shoot with them, they’ll train them.’ ” The NRA offers training for home firearm safety, personal protection and courses on pistol, rifle and shotgun use, according to its website. Dana Loesch, an NRA spokeswoman, appeared on Stinchfield’s show and said Willeford’s actions “kind of goes against the narrative of those with license to carry, doesn’t it.” Willeford told correspondent Denise Sinisi, who interviewed him, that he felt more comfortable talking to the NRA than other media outlets because he didn’t think they would “get it wrong,” Stinchfield said. Willeford’s use of his firearm and his training has made him an “NRA hero,” he said.   Kelley was shot twice — in the leg and torso — before shooting himself in the head, officials said autopsy results showed. Although the NRA has embraced Willeford, it has not always done so with other gun owners in the aftermath of fatal shootings. In the NRA interview with Sinisi, Willeford said he believed that law enforcement officials aren’t afraid of guns owned by NRA members. “They’re not afraid of our guns, and that became evident when I put that rifle on the hood of the truck and started walking back,” he said, motioning his hands up. “He said, ‘Not you,’ ” referring to what officers told him as he approached them. When a Minnesota police officer fatally shot Philando Castile in July 2016, a black man who had a valid permit to carry a gun, the NRA was nearly silent. Castile reportedly notified the officer about the firearm as a precaution and was shot anyway. More than a day after that shooting, the organization released a statement that did not mention Castile by name and called the incident “troubling.” The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. [ In Sutherland Springs, a mass shooting draws desire for more — not fewer — guns ] After the Las Vegas attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, the NRA endorsed restricting “bump stocks,” the device used by gunman Stephen Paddock to accelerate his gunfire as he indiscriminately shot at concertgoers from a hotel room. As the NRA has shown an affinity for Willeford, he has reciprocated its affection. A chair on his porch had a piece of paper with a handwritten warning: “Not Talking to Media! My time is not Free!” Yet Sinisi said that once the family realized who she was, they welcomed her. Sinisi said Willeford told her: “You know, we’re just concerned that our message is going to change when we do an interview, that it’s not going to be exactly what we say or how we feel. It’s going to turn into something that it’s not.” Willeford declined multiple requests by The Washington Post for an interview. Firearms are an “important part” of that community, Sinisi said, adding that families spend time together at the shooting range. The small Texas town of Sutherland Springs is “NRA country,” Stinchfield said. While the majority of Sutherland Springs residents don’t take advantage of the state’s liberal open-carry law, residents said, most people do carry concealed weapons, and most households own at least one weapon and usually several more. “There are lots of guns in the community. Most people own guns in Texas,” Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said Monday. “But guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” Read more: The persistent crime that connects mass shooters and terror suspects: Domestic violence Texas church gunman escaped mental health facility in 2012 after threatening military superiors "

Cardona and Naheed Rajwani The Dallas Morning NewsARLINGTON, Texas — An Arlington man who opened fire on police serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house Tuesday was no stranger to authorities and had attacked an officer before, police said.Vincent Hall, 22, was killed Tuesday in a shootout that seriously wounded one officer and grazed another at a home in the 4300 block of Kelly Hill Road. This photo provided by the Arlington Police Department shows Vincent Hall. (Arlington Police Department via AP)Police SWAT teams were at the home about 4:30 p.m. to serve a no-knock narcotics warrant, meaning they didn't have to announce they were there, and had divided into front yard and backyard teams.Someone inside the duplex peeked out a window, saw officers approaching and alerted the other people inside, Lt. Christopher Cook said.Before the shooting started, police detained four people, including 22-year-old Billy Nevels, who was arrested on misdemeanor warrants out of Dalworthington Gardens.Hall then opened fire on officers with an AR-15 rifle as they tried to enter the home, Cook said.One officer, an 11-year veteran whose name was not released, was dragged to safety after being shot multiple times in the lower extremities. He was in ""great spirits"" a day later as he recovered at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, police said.A second officer, who appeared to be grazed by a bullet, was treated at the scene.""We're very lucky, honestly, that our officers were not more injured and that nothing else tragic occurred,"" Cook said.Five officers returned fire, striking Hall, and then used a robot to determine that no one else was still inside, police said. Shortly before 9 p.m., officers shot gas into the home and, within the hour, confirmed Hall was dead near the front door with a rifle under his body.""At the end of the day, we're happy because this could have gone in a different direction for us,"" Cook said Wednesday.Streets around the area were closed as police investigated. Several residents in the immediate area were evacuated for their safety. Others were being kept from going to their homes, and people who were in their homes were asked to shelter in place.Known suspectPolice had interacted with Hall before Tuesday's shooting, and he had a lengthy arrest history, court records show.He'd been arrested before on charges of drug possession, evading arrest, attempting to take a police officer's weapon and resisting arrest.In 2016, Cook said, the suspect wrestled with an Arlington officer and tried to snatch her gun before escaping.Detectives requested the recent search warrant knowing Hall's criminal history, which Cook said might explain why a no-knock warrant was issued for the suspect's home.Police found the AR-15 next to Hall's body Tuesday night. Four types of drugs, including cocaine, were found inside the home.Police didn't know Wednesday whether any of the detained people would face criminal charges tied to the drugs.On-duty shootingsTuesday's shooting is among several in recent years in which an officer was killed or injured in North Texas.In April 2016, Arlington Officer Eddie Johnston was shot while helping serve a warrant for a man suspected of killing a Saginaw teenager. On July 7, 2016, a gunman ambushed and killed four Dallas police officers and one Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer in downtown Dallas.In September 2016, two Fort Worth police officers were wounded when they responded to a call at a home. Shots were fired as they approached a backyard shed. Police later found one man dead in the shed and the man's father dead inside the home. In May, Dallas firefighter-paramedic William An was wounded when he tried to help police engaged in a standoff with a man who had killed his godfather and shot a neighbor in Old East Dallas. ©2017 The Dallas Morning News "

Gary Gross, with Lakeland Police. Negotiators talked with Roach for about an hour before he came back out of the home, still armed with the shotgun. ""During the last phone conversation with one of our negotiators, he said he was coming out and officers would have to kill him,"" said Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens. ""He made statements that he was bringing his shotgun with him even though numerous requests for him to exit the residence unarmed had been made by our negotiators."" Police said Roach pointed the weapon at them. At least six officers fired at Roach. He was rushed to Lakeland Regional Medical Center, where he died. Jerry Roach is seen in this photo provided by a family member. His nieces, Brenda Walker and Linda Hill believe the standoff shouldn't have escalated to his death. They said Roach called his brother, saying he was scared because his house was surrounded by police. They said Roach's brother came to the scene and provided negotiators Roach’s number but police wouldn’t let the brother talk to Roach or go inside the house. ""If he would've got to talk to his brother, this wouldn't have happened. He would've turned himself in,"" said Linda Hill. ""The police cars were, I mean, all the way around, the helicopters and everything. Just for him. Seventy-one years old. He wasn’t going to shoot anybody at all. If anything, it would've been himself."" Hill said Roach lost his wife a few years ago. When asked why Roach came out of the house with a shotgun when police asked him not to, the nieces said they believe he may have given up, after seeing no one was coming to help him. Roach was well known to police. Department officials said they have responded to Roach's home at least seven times in the past year for various disturbances. People living near his home said he's been an ongoing problem, calling them racial slurs often. But Roach's nieces said the neighbors aren't telling the whole story. They said there has been an ongoing feud for a while. ""Both parties called each other names. Um, the guy that had punched him in the face threw something at his truck one day too,"" said Linda Hill. Lakeland Police said the six officers who shot Roach are on paid administrative leave, pending an investigation into the shooting by Lakeland Police and the State Attorney's Office. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Latest News: Polk County Pictures: Lake Wales Little League, a pillar of community, rebuilds after Irma Polk County school bus attendant charged with child abuse Police: Man arrested, charged with exploiting disabled Winter Haven man WWII vet continues daily flag raising at 97 years old Veteran film, TV stuntman opening Central Florida 'stunt camp' Former Haines City officer writes book on murder of fellow officer State Rep.

Khaleel Thompson, then 18 years old, was shot just after 9 a.m. on May 24 in Crystal's Bassett Creek Park. Authorities say Thompson pointed a weapon at the officers, which was later found to be an airsoft pellet gun. Thompson was shot in the head and side. He survived the shooting. ""This was a justified use of deadly force by the officers,"" Freeman said in a statement. The officers first pleaded with Thompson to drop the weapon and used a non-lethal bean bag rifle to get him to drop it. ""All those measures failed and ultimately the officers feared for their lives and fired numerous shots,"" said Freeman, adding that Thompson is ""fully recovering from his wounds."" The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension's inquiry into the shooting found Thompson had a history of depression and paranoid schizophrenia and several potentially dangerous encounters with police the past few years. That included an October 2015 confrontation with St. Louis Park police, who'd found Thompson on a street with an axe and he told the officers that people were going to die. ""The officers convinced him to drop the axe and they rushed him to the hospital. They later learned that Thompson made the 911 call and hoped to commit suicide by having the police shoot him,"" Freeman's statement said. In two cases in 2016, police were called on incidents where Thompson was taken to the hospital because he was depressed and threatening suicide. ""Doctors said later that Thompson wanted 'death by police,'"" Freeman added. During the investigation into the Crystal shooting, Freeman said investigators discovered a bottle of red nail polish near Thompson and determined that he'd used it to ""cover the orange tip of the gun so police would think it was a real gun, rather than a bb gun."" Two senior prosecutors reviewed the evidence and concluded the use of deadly force against Thompson was justified ""because he put both of his hands on the gun and aimed it directly"" at one of the officers, Freeman said. Days after the shooting, Thompson's mother told MPR News that her son had just been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but was not a threat to officers. Naomi Thompson said Khaleel was out with friends who noticed he was going through a mental health crisis before the shooting and tried without success to get help for him. On Thursday, Thompson told MPR News that her son is now in a care facility, and she is homeless.

Langendorff says he and another man chased down the gunman after he fled the church where he killed more than 20 people. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP) Comment By The Washington Post Johnnie Langendorff stumbled into the crossfire - a total accident. Sunday morning was all routine until then. Langendorff - a lanky Texan with a fuzzy chin beard and the long horns of a bull's skull tattooed across his neck - had breakfast. Then he was driving his truck on the dusty back streets to his girlfriend's house nearby. When he approached the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, he noticed something odd. As he passed the churchgoers' cars parked around the white wood front of the building, he saw that one vehicle's engine was running. It was a pearl-colored SUV, a Ford Explorer, he said. The driver's door was open. A man clad all in black was walking toward the vehicle with a pistol. He was trading shots with another man holding a rifle. ""I never got a look at him,"" Langendorff explained to reporters later, his mouth nervously working a toothpick, when asked about the black-clad shooter. ""I never really saw him. I saw the gunfire."" The man in black hauled off in his SUV. The second man with the rifle - a neighbor unidentified as of Sunday night - came to Langendorff. The two men were strangers. ""He briefed me quickly on what had just happened and said he had to get him,"" Langendorff said later. ""So that's what I did."" As the two men shot off in pursuit in Langerdorff's truck, 26 First Baptist worshipers were dead or bleeding out on the sanctuary's maroon carpet. Dozens were wounded. Sunday's burst of violence would later be recognized as the fifth worst shooting in modern U.S. history, arriving just a month after 58 concertgoers were murdered in Las Vegas. The Texas' victims' ages ran from 5 to 72, according to authorities, though one family said a one-year-old died. The shooter, identified now as Devin Patrick Kelley, first opened fire on the outside of the church just after 11 a.m. with a Ruger assault rifle. Kelley, clad in black tactical gear, then sprayed the building's inside with bullets. He hastily fled the scene after engaging in a gun battle with a neighbor, the same man subsequently riding shotgun in Langendorff's truck. ""It was more see and do,"" Langendorff later told reporters. ""Act now, ask questions later."" Blasted with adrenaline, Langerdorff wove his truck at high-speed through traffic while trying to catch the fleeing car. The speedometer crossed 95 mph while the driver narrated everything to law enforcement. ""I was on the phone with dispatch the entire time,"" he said. ""I gave them the direction we were going, on what road and everything, and that the vehicle was in sight and that I was getting closer and closer to him."" Kelley's vehicle, however, broke from the roadway and crashed into a ditch about 11 miles north of the church. Langerdorff pulled his own truck within 25 yards. ""The gentleman that was with me got out, rested his rifle on my hood and kept it aimed at him, telling him to get out get out. There was no movement, there was none of that.

Freeman Martin, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Service, told The Post authorities had yet to determine whether Kelley was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound or hit in the gunfire at the church. Multiple weapons were found in Kelley's vehicle. On Sunday night, Langendorff explained his reaction to the shooting - jumping into a car chase - was a simple calculation.

Sunday morning was all routine until then. Langendorff – a lanky Texan with a fuzzy chin beard and the long horns of a bull's skull tattooed across his neck – had breakfast. Then he was driving his truck on the dusty back streets to his girlfriend's house nearby. When he approached the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, he noticed something odd. As he passed the churchgoers' cars parked around the white wood front of the building, he saw that one vehicle's engine was running. It was a pearl-colored SUV, a Ford Explorer, he said. The driver's door was open. A man clad all in black was walking toward the vehicle with a pistol. He was trading shots with another man holding a rifle. ""I never got a look at him,"" Langendorff explained to reporters later, his mouth nervously working a toothpick, when asked about the black-clad shooter. ""I never really saw him.

""He briefed me quickly on what had just happened and said he had to get him,"" Langendorff said later. ""So that's what I did."" As the two men shot off in pursuit in Langerdorff's truck, 26 First Baptist worshipers were dead or bleeding out on the sanctuary's maroon carpet. Dozens were wounded.

Kelley, clad in black tactical gear, then sprayed the building's inside with bullets.

Blasted with adrenaline, Langerdorff wove his truck at high-speed through traffic while trying to catch the fleeing car. The speedometer crossed 95 mph while the driver narrated everything to law enforcement. ""I was on the phone with dispatch the entire time,"" he said. ""I gave them the direction we were going, on what road and everything, and that the vehicle was in sight and that I was getting closer and closer to him.""

 Accidental shooting results in the death of a woman and the arrest of grandson

 Investigators believe a 19-year-old Plaquemine man killed his grandmother accidentally with a semi-automatic handgun he had recently purchased.
 ""He told us he was sitting on the floor removing the magazine from his weapon as his grandmother walked past him, the family dog following her,"" said Police Chief Kenneth Payne. ""He was not fully aware that there was still a round in the chamber.""
  The police chief said Blaise Horton lived with his grandmother on Bubba Street in Plaquemine and has been charged with negligent homicide.
 The grandmother, Cathy DuPont Fulton, was shot in the lower back and the bullet moved from there to her shoulder, Payne said. ""The bullet grazed the dog when it was accidentally fired.""
 ""He was sitting on the floor with his pistol and had dropped the magazine out of it,"" he continued.  ""He was not fully aware that the gun had a round in its chamber nor that it could be fired with its magazine out.""
 Payne said Horton was pushing the dog away from him when he dropped the gun and it fired when he caught it.
 Emergency medical technicians with the Plaquemine Fire Department and Acadian Ambulance used CPR on the woman, believed to be in her mid-60s, for about 15 minutes but could not save her, he added. The exact cause of her death will be determined by an autopsy, Hayne said.
 Payne said based on the recording of Horton's 911 call, his account of what happened and evidence at the scene, District Attorney Ricky Ward's office recommended the charge.
 ""When the young man called 911, he didn't know that he'd shot his grandmother,"" the police chief continued. ""He thought she had just passed out.""
 Payne called the incident ""an unfortunate tragedy"" and said it might have been avoided had the grandson been properly trained with his weapon.
 ""I recommend everyone who owns a gun -- no matter the type -- to be familiar with it to reduce the chances of a similar incident,"" he said.

Lakeland Police: Man, 71, armed with shotgun shot, killed by officers Police ID man as Jerry Roach Officers said they have been to home as many as 8 times this year There were no officers injured. According to police, neighbors said Jerry Roach was yelling racial slurs at neighbors and pointing a shotgun in the air outside his home in the 700 block of West Crescent Drive around 9 p.m. Thursday. ""The neighbors called 911. They didn’t know if he was going to come back out or run into their house with a shotgun after he fired the one round. They were scared to death,"" said Sgt. Gary Gross, with Lakeland Police. Negotiators talked with Roach for about an hour before he came back out of the home, still armed with the shotgun. ""During the last phone conversation with one of our negotiators, he said he was coming out and officers would have to kill him,"" said Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens. ""He made statements that he was bringing his shotgun with him even though numerous requests for him to exit the residence unarmed had been made by our negotiators."" Police said Roach pointed the weapon at them. At least six officers fired at Roach. He was rushed to Lakeland Regional Medical Center, where he died. Jerry Roach is seen in this photo provided by a family member. His nieces, Brenda Walker and Linda Hill believe the standoff shouldn't have escalated to his death. They said Roach called his brother, saying he was scared because his house was surrounded by police. They said Roach's brother came to the scene and provided negotiators Roach’s number but police wouldn’t let the brother talk to Roach or go inside the house. ""If he would've got to talk to his brother, this wouldn't have happened. He would've turned himself in,"" said Linda Hill. ""The police cars were, I mean, all the way around, the helicopters and everything. Just for him. Seventy-one years old. He wasn’t going to shoot anybody at all. If anything, it would've been himself."" Hill said Roach lost his wife a few years ago. When asked why Roach came out of the house with a shotgun when police asked him not to, the nieces said they believe he may have given up, after seeing no one was coming to help him. Roach was well known to police. Department officials said they have responded to Roach's home at least seven times in the past year for various disturbances. People living near his home said he's been an ongoing problem, calling them racial slurs often. But Roach's nieces said the neighbors aren't telling the whole story. They said there has been an ongoing feud for a while. ""Both parties called each other names. Um, the guy that had punched him in the face threw something at his truck one day too,"" said Linda Hill. Lakeland Police said the six officers who shot Roach are on paid administrative leave, pending an investigation into the shooting by Lakeland Police and the State Attorney's Office. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Latest News: Polk County Pictures: Lake Wales Little League, a pillar of community, rebuilds after Irma Polk County school bus attendant charged with child abuse Police: Man arrested, charged with exploiting disabled Winter Haven man WWII vet continues daily flag raising at 97 years old Veteran film, TV stuntman opening Central Florida 'stunt camp' Former Haines City officer writes book on murder of fellow officer State Rep.

At least 26 people were killed at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, about 40 miles southeast of San Antonio. That makes it the fourth deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Three of the top four gun massacres on the list – including the deadliest, which was in Las Vegas just over a month ago — occurred in just the past year and a half. The country “has experienced an increase in mass casualty attacks” wrought by mentally troubled individuals “who commit mass murder in furtherance of some perceived grievance or ideological cause,” John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security and consultant for ABC News, said after the massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58. “The shooting in Las Vegas is yet another example of what is becoming a long list of attacks in the United States,” he said on Monday. ABC News has compiled a list of the 10 deadliest mass shootings.   1. Route 91 Harvest Festival, Las Vegas, Nevada – 58 deaths – Oct. 1, 2017 Paddock, from Mesquite, Nevada, was identified by authorities Monday as the lone gunman holed up in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino hotel room, packing as many as 19 guns. At around 10 p.m. he opened fire upon thousands of country music concert attendees below a hotel room, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500. 2. Pulse Nightclub shooting, Orlando, Florida – 49 deaths – June 12, 2016 At around 2 a.m. Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old former security guard, fired bullets and killed 49 people who were inside of an Orlando gay nightclub called Pulse. During the rampage, Mateen, who was a U.S. citizen, was killed by responding police in a shootout. Mateen’s ISIS-inspired hate crime injured more than 50 people. Law enforcement sources told ABC News Mateen’s wife, Noor Mateen, had tried to dissuade her husband from committing the act. She was charged with aiding and abetting him, as well as committing obstruction. Mateen has pleaded not guilty. 3. Virginia Tech University shooting, Blacksburg, Virginia – 32 deaths – April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech senior Seung-hui Cho, 23, purchased a 9mm Glock handgun on March 13, 2007, and a .22-caliber gun within a week before he started shooting people at the Blacksburg, Virginia, campus, including five professors and 26 fellow students. The South Korean-born young man began his rampage inside a dorm room, where two students were shot and killed. Cho, according to police, rearmed at his dorm room and left a note before going out and killing 30 more people in four classrooms, He then turned a gun on himself. 4. First Baptist Church church shooting, Sutherland Springs, Texas – at least 27 deaths – Nov. 5, 2017 At least 26 people were killed and 27 others were injured when a shooter opened fire at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.

He breached the school by shooting out a window pane of the front office, then gunned down and killed 26 people, including 20 first-graders and six adult school staff members. Not included in the death count is the murder of Lanza’s mother Nancy Lanza, who police say was slain before the young man arrived at the school, as well as Adam Lanza, who took his own life at Sandy Hook. 6. Luby’s Cafeteria car ramming and shooting, Killeen, Texas – 23 deaths – Oct. 16, 1991 After slamming his Ford Ranger truck into the window of Luby’s Cafeteria, 35-year-old George Jo Hennard reportedly said “This is what the women of Bell County made me do,” according to the Killeen Daily Herald. He then started firing his guns and murdered 23 people, and left 20 more wounded. Ten of Hennard’s victims were killed by single shots to the head. Once police responded, Hennard retreated to a restroom, where he committed suicide. 7. McDonald’s massacre, San Ysidro, California – 21 deaths – July 18, 1984 James Oliver Huberty entered the fast food chain armed with a long-barreled Uzi, a pump-action shotgun and a handgun and took the lives of 21 adults and children while injuring 19 others, including an elderly person and a baby, according to the San Diego Tribune. An hour after the shootings, a police sharpshooter killed Huberty, reported the San Diego Tribune. Before he went out to commit mass murder, he reportedly told his wife, “I’m going hunting… Hunting for humans,” according to the New York Daily News. Tied for 8. University of Texas Tower Shooting, Austin, Texas – 14 deaths – Aug. 1, 1966 U.S. Marine sniper Charles Joseph Whitman lugged a cache of rifles, pistols and a sawed-off shotgun up to the observation deck of the university’s landmark clock tower. He then fired at will, striking unsuspecting students. He killed 14 people and wounded at least 30. Whitman’s terror was ultimately foiled after police officers Ramiro Martinez and Houston McCoy shot him dead.

San Bernardino mass shooting, Inland Regional Center at San Bernardino, California – 14 deaths – Dec. 2, 2015 Husband and wife Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, dressed in tactical gear and armed themselves with assault rifles and pistols when they entered a mandatory Christmas party at the social services center, where Syed worked, and fatally shot his unarmed colleagues. The couple killed a total of 14 people at the party, then fled the center and died in a hail of bullets on a San Bernardino street when cops caught up to their car. On the day of the attack, FBI agents later confirmed, the couple had researched ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi online. The shooting left 14 dead and at least 17 injured. Tied for 8. Edmond Post Office shooting, Edmond, Oklahoma – 14 deaths – Aug. 20, 1986 Patrick Henry Sherrill, 44, was a part-time postman who returned to his office a day after receiving a “poor performance” review.

He murdered 14 fellow postal workers 10 minutes before fatally shooting himself in the head. Authorities later determined Sherrill was angry that he might lose his job.  Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

At least 26 people were killed at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, about 40 miles southeast of San Antonio. That makes it the fourth deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Three of the top four gun massacres on the list – including the deadliest, which was in Las Vegas just over a month ago — occurred in just the past year and a half. The country “has experienced an increase in mass casualty attacks” wrought by mentally troubled individuals “who commit mass murder in furtherance of some perceived grievance or ideological cause,” John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security and consultant for ABC News, said after the massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58. “The shooting in Las Vegas is yet another example of what is becoming a long list of attacks in the United States,” he said on Monday. ABC News has compiled a list of the 10 deadliest mass shootings.   1. Route 91 Harvest Festival, Las Vegas, Nevada – 58 deaths – Oct. 1, 2017 Paddock, from Mesquite, Nevada, was identified by authorities Monday as the lone gunman holed up in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino hotel room, packing as many as 19 guns. At around 10 p.m. he opened fire upon thousands of country music concert attendees below a hotel room, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500. 2. Pulse Nightclub shooting, Orlando, Florida – 49 deaths – June 12, 2016 At around 2 a.m. Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old former security guard, fired bullets and killed 49 people who were inside of an Orlando gay nightclub called Pulse. During the rampage, Mateen, who was a U.S. citizen, was killed by responding police in a shootout. Mateen’s ISIS-inspired hate crime injured more than 50 people. Law enforcement sources told ABC News Mateen’s wife, Noor Mateen, had tried to dissuade her husband from committing the act. She was charged with aiding and abetting him, as well as committing obstruction. Mateen has pleaded not guilty. 3. Virginia Tech University shooting, Blacksburg, Virginia – 32 deaths – April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech senior Seung-hui Cho, 23, purchased a 9mm Glock handgun on March 13, 2007, and a .22-caliber gun within a week before he started shooting people at the Blacksburg, Virginia, campus, including five professors and 26 fellow students. The South Korean-born young man began his rampage inside a dorm room, where two students were shot and killed.

 iStock/Thinkstock(NEW YORK) -- Sunday morning's shooting in a rural Texas church is among the deadliest gun massacres in modern U.S. history.At least 26 people were killed at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, about 40 miles southeast of San Antonio.That makes it the fourth deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Three of the top four gun massacres on the list - including the deadliest, which was in Las Vegas just over a month ago -- occurred in just the past year and a half.The country ""has experienced an increase in mass casualty attacks"" wrought by mentally troubled individuals ""who commit mass murder in furtherance of some perceived grievance or ideological cause,"" John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security and consultant for ABC News, said after the massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58.""The shooting in Las Vegas is yet another example of what is becoming a long list of attacks in the United States,” he said on Monday.ABC News has compiled a list of the 10 deadliest mass shootings.  1. Route 91 Harvest Festival, Las Vegas, Nevada - 58 deaths - Oct. 1, 2017 Paddock, from Mesquite, Nevada, was identified by authorities Monday as the lone gunman holed up in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino hotel room, packing as many as 19 guns. At around 10 p.m. he opened fire upon thousands of country music concert attendees below a hotel room, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500. 2. Pulse Nightclub shooting, Orlando, Florida - 49 deaths - June 12, 2016At around 2 a.m. Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old former security guard, fired bullets and killed 49 people who were inside of an Orlando gay nightclub called Pulse. During the rampage, Mateen, who was a U.S. citizen, was killed by responding police in a shootout. Mateen's ISIS-inspired hate crime injured more than 50 people. Law enforcement sources told ABC News Mateen's wife, Noor Mateen, had tried to dissuade her husband from committing the act. She was charged with aiding and abetting him, as well as committing obstruction. Mateen has pleaded not guilty. 3. Virginia Tech University shooting, Blacksburg, Virginia - 32 deaths - April 16, 2007Virginia Tech senior Seung-hui Cho, 23, purchased a 9mm Glock handgun on March 13, 2007, and a .22-caliber gun within a week before he started shooting people at the Blacksburg, Virginia, campus, including five professors and 26 fellow students. The South Korean-born young man began his rampage inside a dorm room, where two students were shot and killed. Cho, according to police, rearmed at his dorm room and left a note before going out and killing 30 more people in four classrooms, He then turned a gun on himself. 4. First Baptist Church church shooting, Sutherland Springs, Texas - at least 27 deaths - Nov. 5, 2017At least 26 people were killed and 27 others were injured when a shooter opened fire at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.

Once police responded, Hennard retreated to a restroom, where he committed suicide.7. McDonald's massacre, San Ysidro, California - 21 deaths - July 18, 1984James Oliver Huberty entered the fast food chain armed with a long-barreled Uzi, a pump-action shotgun and a handgun and took the lives of 21 adults and children while injuring 19 others, including an elderly person and a baby, according to the San Diego Tribune.

Once the shooting started Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, there was probably “no way” for congregants to escape, Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. said. The gunman, dressed in black tactical gear, fired an assault rifle as he walked down the center aisle during worship services. He turned around and continued shooting on his way out of the building, Tackitt said. The gunman also carried a handgun, but authorities he did not know if it was fired. Tackitt described the scene as “terrible.” “It’s unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,” he said. The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 72 years old. About 20 other people were wounded. The gunman’s former in-laws attended services at the church “from time to time” but were not there Sunday, Tackitt told CNN on Monday. The suspect was identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. Authorities said he lived in New Braunfels, about 35 miles north of the Sutherland Springs church. A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Kelley did not appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to discuss the investigation. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before the attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force for assaulting his spouse and child and was sentenced to 12 months of confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his 2014 discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. The attacker pulled into a gas station across from the church, about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio, around 11:20 a.m. Sunday. He crossed the street and started firing the rifle at the church, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety. As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who “grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,” Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Authorities believe he shot himself following a car wreck. Twenty-three of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital, Martin said. The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT-TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. He didn’t identify the armed resident but said the man exchanged gunfire with the gunman, then asked to get in Langendorff’s truck and the pair followed as the gunman drove away. Langendorff said the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He said the other man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. He stayed there for at least five minutes, until police arrived. “I was strictly just acting on what’s the right thing to do,” Langendorff said. Among those killed was the church pastor’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message. “We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,” she wrote. “Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation.” Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, who was not at Sunday’s service, told the AP that his cousin, who was eight months’ pregnant, and her in-laws were among those killed. He later told the Houston Chronicle that three of his cousin’s children also were slain. President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an “act of evil,” later calling the gunman “a very deranged individual.” On Sunday evening, two sheriff’s vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. “It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,” Albers said. The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the “wicked nature” of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Gov. Greg Abbott called Sunday’s attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. It came on the eighth anniversary of a shooting at Fort Hood, where 13 people were killed and 31 others wounded by a former Army major. The previous deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in American history, when Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus’ clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower. One victim died a week later, and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.

 Family: Man probably had been drinking before confronting officers

 Lakeland police are investigating a Thursday night shooting where six officers shot and killed a man at a home.

 John Chambliss @ledgercity

 LAKELAND — Jerry Roach had a history of confrontation when he started drinking alcohol.Thursday night was likely no different.In what family members said was yet another alcohol-fueled rant, Roach, 71, yelled racist slurs at his neighbors across the street in North Lakeland, fired a shot in the air from a shotgun and pointed the weapon at them from his front yard.Later, when Lakeland police surrounded his home, Roach told them he was coming out of his Crescent Drive home and officers would have to kill him.About 10:50 p.m., he walked out of his house armed with a shotgun. Officers demanded he drop the gun. When he refused, six officers opened fire. He died at Lakeland Regional Medical Center at 11:20 p.m.District 10 Medical Examiner Stephen Nelson said on Friday that Roach died from multiple gunshot wounds. A pending toxicology report will determine whether Roach was drunk, but family members said an empty whiskey bottle in the trash was evidence that he had been drinking hard into the night.The officers involved in the shooting are Camilo Almeida, Nick Harrison, Travis Miller, Sean Mulderrig, Raj Patel and John Renew. Handguns, rifles and shotguns were all used in the shooting.The State Attorney's Office will conduct an investigation into whether the shooting was justified.
 Police spokesman Gary Gross said an internal investigation will determine how many shots were fired at Roach.
 Family members said police could have prevented the shooting.
 ""He never would have harmed anyone,"" said his granddaughter, Katie Scarbro.
 Roach, who was retired from a tile business, had been depressed ever since his wife of 42 years, Mary Sue, died of cancer in October 2011.
 He started drinking whisky more and more, Scarbro said.
 ""That was his coping mechanism,"" she said.
 Scarbro said the upcoming holiday season combined with the anniversary of her death always made him think of his late wife even more.
 ""They lived in that house together for more than 30 years,"" Scarbro said.
 Scarbro was awakened last night by family and friends who told her that police had surrounded her grandfather's home.
 She called her mother to tell her then drove to his home where she met her mom.
 The shooting had just happened.
 His son-in-law, Randy Bell, acknowledged Roach was a racist. But he said Roach was a hard worker who cared for his family.
 Standing in the grass next to blood on the grass that Roach lost after he was shot, Bell pointed to 15 bullet holes in the house.
 ""They just riddled a 71-year-old with bullets,"" Bell said. ""I know he would have listened to his family and dropped the gun.""
 He asked why police couldn't have tried to subdue him rather than kill him.
 Gross, the spokesman, said that wasn't realistic for officers who faced a man coming at them with a shotgun. He said officers had answered calls for disturbances at his home eight times this year.
 ""He was known to officers,"" Gross said.

 Second Amendment Texas church shooting not the first time a good guy with gun takes down mass shooter By Andrew O'Reilly | Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email close Video shows moments after church shooter crashed truck Johnnie Langendorff, who drove after Devin Kelley, releases video from moments after high-speed chase ended.
 The armed civilian who used his assault rifle to stop Sunday’s mass murder of 26 Texas churchgoers has been hailed, rightly, as a hero, but Stephen Willeford is hardly unique. A number of armed American citizens have also used their firearms to stop or limit mass killings.
 The former National Rifle Association instructor who lives next door to the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, grabbed his AR-15-style rifle after hearing the gunfire and went over to investigate. Confronting the shooter, Devin Kelley, Willeford shot him in the leg and torso before Kelley dropped his weapon and fled the scene in his SUV.
 As horrific as Kelley’s rampage was, it could have been much worse if it wasn’t for Stephen Willeford.
 “I thank my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done,” Willeford told local media on Monday. “I just wish I could have gotten there faster.”
 Willeford has quickly become an example for pro-gun advocates to point to when defending their argument that the best defense against mass shooting is a better-armed and better-trained civilian populace that is ready to defend itself, anytime and anywhere.
 But – while not as common compared to the overall number of mass shootings in the U.S. – Willeford is certainly not the first “good guy with a gun” to stop a mass shooter’s killing spree in recent years.
 Experts may disagree on how the number of mass shootings stopped by civilians is counted. Do off-duty police officers count as civilians? What about military members? And how many people need to be killed or injured for it to be considered a mass shooting? But there are a number of incidents over the last 20 years where an armed bystander helped prevent further tragedy.
 Here are a few examples of such incidents: More on this... Texas shooting: FBI again finds itself unable to unlock a gunman's cellphone Botched Air Force handling of Texas shooter's criminal history may be 'systemic' issue -- In 1997, the assistant principal of Mississippi’s Pearl High School, Joel Myrick, used the .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol he kept in his truck to detain 16-year-old Luke Woodham after the teenager stabbed and bludgeoned to death his mother at home and killed two students and injured seven at the high school.
 -- A decade later, in 2007, Matthew Murray killed four people at Colorado Spring church before being shot by church member and volunteer security guard Jeanne Assam.
 -- Last April, an Uber driver with a concealed-carry permit shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people in Chicago’s Logan Square.
 -- This September, an usher at a Tennessee church used his personal firearm to subdue a masked gunman who had already killed one woman in the church’s parking lot and injured six others inside.
 Gun-rights advocates say that not only do these gun-carrying civilians prove that an armed populace can help mitigate the death toll of a mass shooter, but could also prevent mass shootings as a whole from happening.
 “These killers all say they target places where people normally don’t carry guns,” John Lott, the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said. “So concealed-carry acts as a deterrent to these killers and would also stop these shootings from being much worse.”
 Those in favor of limiting access to firearms, however, argue that many of these mass shooters should not have had access to a gun in the first place – given some of their criminal and mental health records – and that the “good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun” argument is unsupported by facts or research.
 “If having more guns in society worked to deter shootings, then America would have the lowest rate of gun violence of any developed country,” Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign, said in a statement provided to Fox News. “Put simply, the myth that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun is unsupported by facts or research. The killer in this mass shooting should never have had access to a gun in the first place, given his criminal record.”
 James Jacobs, a professor at New York University’s School of Law who has written extensively about gun laws in the U.S., said that there are flaws in the arguments of both supporters and opponents of gun control – noting that there are already thousands of guns in the country that are unaccounted for and those could easily end up in the hands of someone who wanted to commit mass murder.
 “I’m skeptical on the ability to clamp down on guns. That horse has already left the stable,” Jacobs said. “Most people who are highly dangerous don’t go to a legal gun dealer. They go on the internet or the black market or just get someone else to buy a gun for them.”
 Jacobs added that instead of having one law governing firearms on a national – or even state – level, whether or not civilians should be able to carry a gun in public should come down to individual counties or even communities.
 “There is not a one-size fits all solution to this issue,” he said. “What works in Alaska or rural Wyoming will not work in cities like Chicago or Detroit.”
