## How to run?

Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the current directory, and it will serve
the website. Now, just to screw around with the stuff in the folder and make
it exactly what we want.

Also, 2013.csv is the csv file being automatically read in, for reasons instantaneously unclear
to me (perhaps because it's the csv last alphabetically).

Also, I'm still looking for where the long lat data is stored for 'where' each country is, exactly.
