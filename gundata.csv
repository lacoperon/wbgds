Larry James Jackson of North Little Rock and co-defendant Deshaun Malik Rushing, 22, of North Little Rock made their second Circuit Court appearances Thursday, with new lawyers. They had been represented by public defenders. The judge set a Dec. 4 evidentiary hearing for the defendants. Jackson is to stand trial on Dec. 5, and Rushing's trial is set for February. Chief deputy prosecutor John Johnson told the judge he wanted to try Jackson first. Jackson and Rushing are charged with capital murder and unlawful discharge of a firearm over the November 2016 slaying of Ramiya Reed, the toddler who was killed just before Thanksgiving while she was riding in a car in southwest Little Rock with her mother and several cousins. [HOMICIDE MAP: Interactive map of Little Rock’s 2016 killings] Authorities say the toddler's killing sparked an escalation in violence between feuding gangs in Little Rock, particularly the Monroe Street Hustlers and the Murder Mafia. Jackson and Rushing were arrested in May, six months after the girl's death and after her mother, Rokiya Williams, told police that Jackson and Rushing each had a pistol and were in the vehicle from which the fatal shot was fired, according to an arrest affidavit. Rushing's new attorney is Ron Davis, who has represented numerous defendants charged with high-profile violent crimes. Davis appeared in court Thursday fresh from his successful defense on Wednesday of a Little Rock man whom the jury acquitted on self-defense grounds. Among Davis' clients is Gary Eugene Holmes, charged with capital murder in what police have described as the road-rage slaying of another Little Rock toddler, who was killed a month after the shooting of Ramiya Reed. He also represented Quenton King, the Little Rock restaurateur convicted last month for killing his longtime mistress, who was pregnant with his daughter. Defense attorney Willard Proctor, a former circuit judge who regularly represents teenagers charged with violent crimes, has taken on Jackson's case. Jackson was 16 when the girl was killed. In his transfer petition, Proctor acknowledges that Jackson has prior convictions both in juvenile court and as an adult. He describes Jackson's prospects for rehabilitation in the juvenile-justice system as ""extremely good."" ""The offense is not a part of a repetitive pattern of adjudicated offenses that would lead to the determination that the juvenile is beyond rehabilitation,"" the petition states. ""The prior history, character traits and mental maturity all indicate that the juvenile's prospects for rehabilitation are extremely good."" Jackson has been classified as an adult defendant since he was 14, when he was arrested in October 2014 on suspicion of armed robbery. He was carrying a gun and on juvenile probation when police took him into custody. By the time he was charged in Ramiya's death, Jackson already had two felony theft convictions, had served six months in a youth lockup and was facing two more felony charges, both of them involving stolen cars.

She and her mother hurried next door to help the teenager.“I really couldn’t look at him. I seen how he looked, and I walked out. My momma did what she could. She put pressure on the open wound until the ambulance got there,” Macy said.Macy says the others inside the house left Tovaris there. Police have not confirmed how many people were at the house.Seven hours after Tovaris shot himself, a shot rang out in the early morning, hitting Macy’s house.“We were in the living room and having a conversation about what happened and how shocking it was. All you heard were gunshots and Mom said, ‘Get to the floor,’” Macy said.Macy says they were told the shot that hit their home was meant for the victim’s house. Police are searching for the person who fired that retaliatory shot.Friends say Tovaris was full of life, always happy to joke around and uplift those around him.“He was a real fun person. He was very cool to be around. When you’re down, he always raised you up,” Macy said.Copyright 2017 WTVA, Facebook via CNN. All rights reserved."

Since then, he's served time, been charged with four other felonies and is still using guns for nefarious purposes. Why would he be considered eligible for juvenile court? His behavior is anything but juvenile. On another note, it would be interesting to know what kind of childhood and home life he's had. Baby momma? Gangsta role models?

 CRIME Officials: Teenager dies after playing Russian Roulette Associated Press Facebook Twitter Print Email
 COLUMBUS, Miss. –  Authorities say a Mississippi teenager who shot himself while playing Russian Roulette has died.
 Lowndes County Coroner Greg Merchant told news media that 17-year-old Tovaris Deloach died Wednesday afternoon at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Golden Triangle. Officers found Deloach in a bedroom with an apparent gunshot wound to the head Tuesday.
 Columbus police spokesman Joe Dillion says three other males in the room told officers Deloach was discussing Russian Roulette as he took out a revolver and removed the bullets.
 Dillion says Deloach put a bullet in the chamber, held the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, but the gun didn't discharge. He later pulled the trigger for a second time and the weapon fired.
 Authorities said an apparent retaliation shooting happened hours after later. No one was injured.
